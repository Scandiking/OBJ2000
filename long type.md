The `long` datatype in Java is a __primitive data type__ used to store very large whole numbers that exceed the range of the `int` data type. It is a 64-bit signed integer, meaning it uses 8 bytes of memory and can represent a range of values from **-9,223,372,036,854,775,808** to **9,223,372,036,854,775,807**.
The range is used in many specific scenarios including fields like __space science__, financial calculations, cryptography and big data processing.

- Default value is `0L`. 
- Uses 8 bytes (64 bits), making it the largest of the primitive integer types. 
- Suffix `L`: Values assigned to `long` should be suffixed with `L` or `l` to distinguish them from `int`. 

``` java
long population = 7900000000L; // Earth's population
```

- Memory usage
	- `long` takes twice as much memory as `int` (8 bytes vs. 4 bytes). 
- Performance
	- Arithmetic operations on `long` are slightly slower compared to `int` due to the increased size
- Clarity
	- Using `long` unnecessarily might make your code less clear, especially when `int` suffices

If your case doesn't requre numbers larger than `int` can handle , stick with `int` for better memory efficiency and performance
