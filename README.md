### Notes from object-oriented programming (OBJ2000)

This is not your usual GitHub repo. This is a "back-up" of `.md`-files from the note-taking app Obsidian.

Every new Obsidian document is a `.md` itself, the only difference is the `[[link]]` formatting which links to a different note within the same folder. Pretty much like the Markdowm-standard `[Title text](URL)` If you want you can download the whole folder and take a look yourself, but mind you: at your own risk. These are personal notes and I take no responsibility for potential errors. Sources are _mostly_ but not limited to: Liang, 2020[^1].

In addition there is a stub of a website consisting of `.html`-files. These will not be updated anymore.
