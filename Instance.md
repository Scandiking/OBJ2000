An object is an instance of a class. You can create many instances of a class. Creating an instance is referred to as instantiation. The terms _object_ and _instance_ are often interchangeable. The relationship between classes and objects is analogous to that between an apple-pie recipe and apple pies: You can make as many apple pies as you want from a single recipe.

__Example__:
``` java
// Creates a new instance of the Scanner object.
// The instance is identified by the identifier scanscan.
Scanner scanscan = new Scanner();
```
