## Key Characteristics of Methods in Java:
1. __[[Encapsulation]]__: Methods encapsulates functionality, allowing you to reuse code without repeating it
2. __Parameters__: Methods can accept input values (parameters) to work with
3. __Return Type__: Methods can return a values (specified by return type) or perform an action without returning anything (`void`).
4. __Invocation__: Methods are executed by calling them, typically on an [[object]] or a [[class]]
