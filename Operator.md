Java provides _operators_ that perform numeric operations
`+` (addition)
`-` (subtraction)
`*` (multiplication)
`/` (division)
`%` (remainder)

In Java, the equal sign `=`, is used as an assigment operator.

Java provides the augmented assignment operators 
`+=` (addition assignment), 
`-=` (subtraction assignment), 
`*=` (multiplication assignment), 
`/=` (division assignment) and 
`%=` (remainder assignment).

The increment operator `++` and the decrement operator `--` increment or decrement a [[variable]] by `1`. You will often see e.g. `x = 1; x >= 100; i++` in a for loop.
