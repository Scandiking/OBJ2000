__Primitive__ data type used to store whole numbers ([[Integer type]]) in a slightly larger range than the [[byte type]] but smaller than [[Integer type]]. It is a 16-bit signed integer, meaning it uses 2 bytes of memory and can represent a range of values from -32.768 to 32.767.

- Suitable for saving memory in large arrays of numbers where the values fit withing the range of [[short type]].
- Useful in embedded systems or memory-critical applications.

__Declaration and initialization__:
``` java
short minValue = -32768; // Minimum value
short maxValue = 32767; // Max value
short average = 15000; // Example value
```

__Arithmetic operations__:
``` java
short a = 10;
short b = 20;
short sum = (short) (a + b); // Explicit casting is needed for operations
System.out.println("Sum: " + sum); // Output: sum: 30
```

__note__: Arithmetic operations on `short` promote the operands to `int`, so casting back to `short` is often required.

``` java
short[] numbers = new short[1000]; // Takes 2 KB of memory
int[] numbers = new int[1000]; // Takes 4 KB of memory
```
